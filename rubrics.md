# Grading Rubrics

## How It Works
All rubrics are scored on 5-point scales, based on the following grade equivalents:

| 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| F | D | C | B | A | A+ |

Depending on the assessment item, your rubric may be scored by one or more members of the teaching team. In many group settings, each member of the teaching team is assigned a subset of students to grade. In such cases, we rotate which students are graded by which teaching team members, to ensure fairness.

To compute your numerical grade based on rubric scores, we will first calculate the mean score across dimensions, round to one decimal point, and then convert the score to a percentage based on the following conversion table:

| 0.0 | 1.0 | 2.0 | 3.0 | 4.0 | 4.5 | 5.0 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0%  | 50% | 60% | 70% | 80% | 90% | 100% |

Some examples of how this works:
- your mean is 1.75; your grade is 50% of the available points for that assignment
- your mean is 1.98; your grade is 60% of the available points (because 1.98 rounds to 2.0)
- your mean is 4.4; your grade is 80% of the available points
- your mean is 4.9; your grade is 90% of the available points
