# Demos

## Topics
Many students in previous semesters have also struggled with topics and format for Demo 1 (don’t worry, inspiration abounds thereafter). Remember to (re)visit the syllabus for the original description, with special attention to the “rubric with four components: quality of content, quality of explanation, quality of presentation, and relevance/usefulness of topic, with a few bonus points available for creativity.”

An initial sentiment has commonly been, “What can I teach people when I don’t know very much yet?” However, it’s more fitting to think of it as sharing something, rather than teaching something. For example, you can share:
- an interesting Ted Talk or a podcast related to data science by writing a brief synopsis (including a link to the video);
- a new feature you discovered on DataCamp, or a helpful study trick/habit you developed that makes it easier to work through the exercises; or indeed
- an actual piece of code not yet introduced in the course or DataCamp exercises that you’ve found to be helpful, highly applicable, or just interesting in some way(s). This can be shared in a video recording (see below for a student demo on how to make one using Panopto) or a well-annotated series of screenshots.

## Scope & tips:  
- **Audio/video**: <= 5:00 min. We will stop listening/watching at the 5:00 min mark, and evaluate only that portion of the demo.
- **Written**: <= 500 words. Be sure to summarize--avoid plagiarism at all costs!  
- Speak about your experience (budding though it may be), and consider your audience. Mention how your demo topic benefited or impacted you, and why others may find it helpful or interesting.
- For top marks, go beyond simply introducing your topic (e.g., “Here’s a video. Here’s a link. I liked it. You might too.”), and reflect more meaningfully. For example, discuss (or at least posit) novel ways, both broad and specific, that your topic applies to data science and/or this course.
